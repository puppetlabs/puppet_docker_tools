## [Unreleased]
## [0.2.2] - released 2018-10-05
### Fixed
- We weren't passing the path of the dockerfile to `docker build` which caused
  failures when working with non-default dockerfiles

## [0.2.1] - released 2018-10-01
### Added
- Added `docker_run_options` method to the `with_docker_container` RSpec context.
  This can be overwritten to pass additional options to the `docker run` command

### Fixed
- In the `with_docker_container` RSpec context, fail if the `docker run` command
  exits with a non-zero exit code
- In the `with_docker_container` RSpec context, print container logs if the
  container ends up in a known bad state

## [0.2.0] - released 2018-09-17
### Fixed
- If an invalid parameter is passed, exit with a non-zero exit code.

### Changed
- In order to support building and testing on Windows hosts, we have moved away
  from using the `docker-api` rubygem. The changes to
  PuppetDockerTools::Utilities and PuppetDockerTools::Runner should be
  transparent, but changes to the spec helper, shared examples, and shared
  contexts will require test changes. For an example of converting existing
  tests to use the new helpers, see [this commit](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver/commit/ecd9e6df90acd6f8768b0eac65a96f2910fb43e9).

## [0.1.5] - released 2018-07-05
### Added
- Add the ability to pass `--version` to the push subcommand

### Fixed
- Documentation cleanup

## [0.1.4] - released 2018-06-27
### Added
- (CPR-598) Add the ability to filter buildargs at runtime. Older versions of
  docker will fail a build if there are buildargs passed that aren't in the
  dockerfile, so only pass in buildargs that align with the ARGs in the
  dockerfile. A message is printed for ignored buildargs
- (CPR-590) Add `--no-latest` option to not build a `latest` tag along with the
  versioned tag. This is useful if you're building containers from multiple
  version streams
- Improve `get_value_from_env` to support retrieving values from variables set
  to other variables

## [0.1.3] - released 2018-06-21
### Added
- (CPR-584) Add support for passing version and arbitrary buildargs at container
  build time

### Fixed
- The `get_value_from_env` method was not properly interpolating environment
  variables if they were quoted in the label. We now support either
  `label=$variable` or `label="$variable"`

## [0.1.2] - released 2018-06-12
### Added
- Generate build-date and vcs-ref at build time and pass those on to the image
  build as buildargs
- Add 'a running container' shared example to the spec helper for use when
  timing issues crop up (primarily in external CI pipelines that have more
  latency)
- Add `puppet-docker local-lint` command. This allows for hadolint to be run
  with a locally installed binary on your $PATH rather than by spinning up the
  hadolint docker container

## [0.1.1] - released 2018-05-24
### Changed
- For the lint task, ignore version pinning for `apk install`
- Reorganize `spec_helper` for ease of loading in external projects. Spec tests
  can now `require 'puppet_docker_tools/spec_helper'`
- Update the `spec` task to use `Open3.popen2e` instead of `RSpec::Core::Runner.run`
  so the task can fail if anything fails while running the tests

## [0.1.0] - released 2018-05-18
### Added
- Initial port of the automation from [puppet-in-docker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker)
